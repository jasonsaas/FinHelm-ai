# Security Guidelines for FinHelm-ai

This document outlines the security best practices and requirements tailored to the FinHelm-ai codebase. It translates industry-standard principles into actionable guidelines to ensure the application is secure by design, resilient in operation, and maintains user trust.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

**1.1 Secure Password Storage**
- Use bcrypt (or Argon2) with a unique salt per user.  
- Enforce strong password policies: minimum 12 characters, mixed case, digits, and symbols.  
- Implement account lockout or exponential back-off after repeated failed login attempts.

**1.2 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
- Sign tokens using a strong algorithm (e.g., HS256 with a long, random secret or RS256 with private/public keys).  
- Validate the signature, issuer (`iss`), audience (`aud`), and expiration (`exp`) on every request.  
- Keep token lifetime short (e.g., 15â€“60 minutes) and implement refresh tokens with strict revocation checks.

**1.3 Session Management & CSRF**
- If using cookies, set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes.  
- Protect state-changing endpoints with anti-CSRF tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern) when relying on cookies.

**1.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Define clear roles (e.g., `user`, `admin`) and associated permissions.  
- Enforce authorization checks server-side on every protected endpoint.  
- Never trust client-side flags for permission decisions.

**1.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Future Phase)**
- Plan for optional MFA via SMS/Email/TOTP for high-value actions (password resets, profile changes).

## 2. Input Handling & Processing

**2.1 Input Validation**
- Validate and sanitize all incoming data server-side using a schema library (Zod, Joi).  
- Reject or normalize unexpected fields; enforce type, format, length, and value constraints.

**2.2 Prevent Injection Attacks**
- Use parameterized queries or an ORM (TypeORM, Prisma) for all database interactions.  
- Escape or strip dangerous characters in any commands or file paths.

**2.3 Output Encoding & XSS Mitigation**
- Apply context-aware encoding (HTML, JavaScript, URL) to data rendered in templates or APIs.  
- Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources.

**2.4 File Upload Security**
- Validate file type, extension, and size on the server.  
- Store uploads outside the webroot with randomized filenames and restrictive permissions.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

**3.1 Encryption**
- Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all transport; disable weak ciphers and protocols.  
- Encrypt sensitive fields at rest (e.g., PII) using AES-256 where needed.

**3.2 Secrets Management**
- Do not hardcode secrets in code or commit them to version control.  
- Use a secrets vault or managed service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) for database credentials, JWT secrets, API keys.

**3.3 Logging & GDPR/CCPA Compliance**
- Mask or omit PII from logs.  
- Retain audit trails of access to sensitive data but purge or anonymize logs per regulatory requirements.

## 4. API & Service Security

**4.1 HTTPS Enforcement**
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS at the load-balancer or server level.  
- Use HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security` header) with a long max-age.

**4.2 Rate Limiting & Throttling**
- Apply rate limits per IP or user on authentication and transaction endpoints to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.

**4.3 CORS Configuration**
- Whitelist only trusted origins in production.  
- Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for sensitive endpoints.

**4.4 API Versioning**
- Version all public APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/accounts`) to support backward-compatible changes.

**4.5 Least Privilege**
- Ensure service accounts and database users have the minimal privileges required for each operation.

---

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

**5.1 Security Headers**
- Content-Security-Policy: restrict script and style sources.  
- X-Frame-Options: `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` to prevent clickjacking.  
- X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`.  
- Referrer-Policy: `no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

**5.2 Cookie Hardening**
- Mark session or refresh token cookies as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict`.

**5.3 Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
- When loading third-party scripts or styles, include SRI hashes to detect tampering.

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

**6.1 Secure Server Configuration**
- Disable unused services and default accounts on OS and application servers.  
- Apply regular security updates and patching via automated tools.

**6.2 Deployment Practices**
- Run debug features and verbose error pages only in non-production environments.  
- Build immutable infrastructure artifacts (e.g., container images) and deploy via CI/CD pipelines.

**6.3 Network Segmentation**
- Restrict database access to internal subnets.  
- Expose only required ports; use firewalls and security groups.

**6.4 Environment Parity**
- Use the same configuration patterns (containerization, environment variables) across dev, staging, and production.

---

## 7. Dependency Management

**7.1 Secure Dependencies**
- Vet all third-party packages for active maintenance, community adoption, and known vulnerabilities.  
- Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) to ensure reproducible builds.

**7.2 Vulnerability Scanning**
- Integrate automated SCA tools (e.g., GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) into CI to detect and remediate CVEs.

**7.3 Minimal Footprint**
- Remove unused packages and code.  
- Favor smaller, single-purpose libraries over large monoliths.

---

## 8. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response

- Implement centralized logging and alerting (Winston/Pino + ELK/CloudWatch).  
- Monitor authentication failures, rate-limit triggers, and anomalous API usage.  
- Define an incident response plan with clear escalation paths and post-mortem procedures.
