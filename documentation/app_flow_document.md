# App Flow Document for FinHelm-ai

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand new user arrives, they see a welcome page with options to sign up or log in. To create an account, the user clicks sign up and enters their name, email, and chooses a strong password. After submitting the form, they receive a brief confirmation message and are automatically taken to their dashboard. Returning users click log in, enter their email and password, and then land on the main page. If someone forgets their password, they click the “Forgot password” link on the login page, enter their email address, and receive a reset link. Following the link brings them to a page where they can choose a new password. Once they update it, they can log in as usual. Logging out is available from every page via a logout button in the top navigation, which ends the session and returns the user to the welcome page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, users arrive at the main dashboard. This page shows a summary of their financial snapshot at a glance. A header across the top displays the application logo, a greeting with the user’s name, and the logout button. Along the left side, there is a vertical navigation menu with items for Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, and Profile. The central section of the dashboard displays the total balance across all accounts and a list of the most recent transactions. At the bottom of that list, a link invites users to view all transactions. At the top of the central pane is a button to add a new account and another to record a new transaction. From this main view, users can click any of the navigation items to move to the detailed pages for accounts, transactions, or reviewing their profile settings.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When users choose the Accounts item, they see a page listing every financial account they have created. Each account entry shows the account name, type, and balance, with an edit icon next to it. To create a new account, users click the “Add Account” button at the top of the Accounts page, which brings up a form requesting the account name, account type (such as checking or savings), and opening balance. After submission, the new account appears in the list and the user is redirected back to the Accounts page with a success message. Editing an existing account follows the same pattern: clicking the edit icon opens the form pre-filled with the current details, and saving updates the list.

On the Transactions page, users see a table of all their recorded transactions sorted by date. At the top of this page is a button labeled “New Transaction.” Clicking it opens a form where users select the target account from a dropdown, enter the amount, choose a category, set the date, and optionally add a description. After saving, they return to the Transactions page and see the new entry. Each transaction row has a delete icon that, when clicked, asks the user to confirm. Confirming removes the transaction and updates the account balances automatically. Filters for date range or category are accessible via a button that toggles a search area above the table, letting users narrow down the list.

The Profile section holds all personal information. It contains a form showing the user’s current name and email. To update these fields, the user edits the form and clicks save. The changes reflect immediately in the header greeting. If the user needs to change their password, they click a “Change Password” link on the same page, fill in their current password and choose a new one, then save. They will see a confirmation that the password has been updated.

## Settings and Account Management
In the Settings area, which is part of the Profile page, users can configure their preferences. Here they can enable or disable email notifications for account or transaction events, if those options are set up in the future. For now, they can update personal details and change the password. The profile update and password change actions both provide success or error messages at the top of the page. When users finish making changes, they can click the Dashboard link in the side menu or the logo in the header to navigate back to the main dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user submits invalid data or leaves required fields blank on any form, the application displays a clear error message next to each problematic field and prevents submission until the issues are corrected. If the server cannot be reached due to network problems, a banner appears at the top of the page explaining that connectivity has been lost, and the user can retry actions once the connection returns. When entering incorrect login credentials, a generic error message tells the user the email or password is incorrect. If a user attempts to access any page without a valid session, they are redirected to the login page. In case of server errors, such as when saving a transaction fails unexpectedly, a modal window informs the user that something went wrong and offers a retry button or a link to contact support.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
Overall, a new user begins by signing up, logs into their dashboard, and then smoothly navigates between managing accounts, entering transactions, and editing profile information whenever needed. The main goal is for users to quickly record their financial data and see updated balances on the dashboard. Throughout the experience, clear messages guide them and prevent errors. The journey ends with the user feeling in control of their finances, able to log out securely, and return anytime to continue tracking accounts and transactions.
