## Understanding Key Metrics

### Cash Position Interpretation

**Healthy Range:** 3-6 months of operating expenses
**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Less than 30 days of operating expenses
- ⚠️ Declining trend over 4+ weeks
- ⚠️ Large unexpected outflows

**Action Items:**
- Review upcoming receivables
- Evaluate payment terms with customers
- Consider credit line utilization

### 13-Week Forecast Confidence

**Confidence Levels Explained:**
- **90%+ Confidence**: Based on recurring transactions and established patterns
- **70-89% Confidence**: Includes seasonal adjustments and market factors  
- **50-69% Confidence**: Incorporates growth projections and variable factors
- **<50% Confidence**: Significant uncertainty due to limited data or volatility

**Using Forecast Data:**
- Plan major purchases during positive cash flow periods
- Identify potential cash shortfalls 6-8 weeks in advance
- Communicate financing needs to lenders proactively

### DSO Analysis

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Professional Services: 30-45 days

**Improvement Strategies:**

- Consider factoring for immediate cash flow

### DPO Optimization

**Strategic Considerations:**
