```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) Ã— Number of Days in Period

FinHelm AI Enhancement:

```

#### Advanced DSO Components

**Customer Segmentation Analysis**
- **Enterprise Customers** (>$50k annual revenue): Typically 45-60 day payment cycles

- **Small Business Customers** (<$10k annual): Generally 15-30 day payment cycles
- **Government/Public Sector**: Often 60-90 day payment cycles due to bureaucratic processes

**Payment Pattern Recognition**
- Identifies customers who consistently pay early, on-time, or late
- Recognizes seasonal payment patterns (e.g., retail customers paying slower in Q1)
- Flags customers with deteriorating payment behavior for proactive management

**Collection Efficiency Scoring**
